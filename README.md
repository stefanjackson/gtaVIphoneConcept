# GTA V In-game "Iphone" Concept 

In-game "Iphone" concept for GTA V role-play servers with Chat capability. 
The goal of customized role-play servers is to provide players with the most immersive, unique in-game experiences that may not be provided by the original game. With that in mind
I am trying to simmulate a real-life phone experience by providing the utilities typically found on an actual Iphone.


Features in its current state include :
-"text" capability which sends messages to the server-wide chat.
-100 character limit (can change to any limit) to prevent spam messages in chat.
-functioning "back/exit" button to close the phone which mimics the older iPhone buttons.


Future Improvements :
-functioning "apps" on the phone 
-"Twitter" style app to tweet and send photos in game accross the whole server
-direct message capability - a true "texting" experience to message players directly.
-functioning "settings" section of phone which will allow for more customizable experience (example - change font style/size, background color/ image, etc...)


Bellow is a video showcasing its current state and functionalities listed above. The output to the server chat including messages and character limit messages will be seen 
in the top left corner of the screen.
